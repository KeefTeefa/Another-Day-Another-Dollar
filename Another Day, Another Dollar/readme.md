#Mod Info
Another Day, Another Dollar is about precisely that; making another dollar every day. It adds something like 100 new spells, 30 monsters, 10 locations, a ridiculous number of items, and a suite of new NPCs.
Cash has new value, easily traded for almost anything to the right buyer. Professionals are new shopkeepers, found at forges and elsewhere throughout the world, that provide a new source of Denarius. 
The prices of items in Another Day, Another Dollar are far above those in the base game. They don't sell well, but they're expensive to buy. The mod's goal is to provide a late game challenge that can only be conquered
through planning. Boss enemies will appear that are simply above the level of a base-game character, which are necessary to advance into the final tier of the game and face the one that started this mess. 

In this world, magic was as worthless as everything else, tossed aside as soon as the new model came out. The value of the dollar plummeted, disappearing into the top of the pyramid.
Magical trinkets and scrolls can be found in any home, making anyone a would-be wizard. Some NPCs will spawn with spells, others can be taught easily. Either way, Hell has come to Earth. 
Goblins, the vanguard of Hell, were the first to arrive and set up encampments. Soon, ghosts of the dead found themselves bound to this plane. Then demons, foul-smelling creatures made of Brimstone tore the rest to shreds.
By the end of the fiscal year, the world will crawl with the forces of Hell. It's lieutenants will soon make their appearance. In the meantime, it's best you spend your time wisely. It's just any other day, after all.

#Getting Started
First off, cold hard cash is now your best friend. Even after the Earth was destroyed, somebody is still selling goods for top dollar. Guess they need the cash for something. The construction menu can be used to create
Altars of Worship, which are used as tools and to spend money. Magic Circles can also be etched into the ground, necessary for crafting or usable as translocation circles. The basic magic circle provides the White Circle 
quality, but other colors exist. The first level of Worship is needed to buy from the Catalogue, a new section in the Crafting Menu. Here, cash can be spent for just about anything. Another Day serves as 
the miscellaneous section where magical items can be crafted with new and old ingredients. Watch out for twisted souls, they can be activated to increase your intelligence and mana capacity, or save them and turn them 
into a stronger version when your Spellcraft is higher. I recommend you play with other mods that make you stronger like Bombastic Perks, Stats through Kills, or Mind Over Matter. Some enemies are best left alone in this 
mod, at least until you can find some way to pull the wool over their eyes. The Bosses are the best example of this, they serve as the gateway to true power. Beat them, you can beat almost anybody. Pretty easy to find, too.
Some enemies will be resistant to certain damage types, like Blastlids (tiny, bothersome imps made of Brimstone) who laugh off flames. In exchange, an Ice Spike would tear straight through the little guy! 
If you feel too weak, you can always get into spirit forgery, allowing you to tailor your strengths and weaknesses. Better that than a Pact with the One Below, which would cast God aside and leave you stranded in his waking 
hell. Cheap though!


A quick breakdown of recipe categories: The mod adds two new categories, Another Day and Catalogue. Another Day is for general magical crafting related to this mod, and Catalogue is for purchases made using one of
the mods forms of currency.
Inside Another Day you'll find:
-Another Dollar, which is used for larger, 'complete' items.
-Petty Cash, which is used for smaller/intermediate items that are usually crafted into larger things themselves. This is just a general rule, and Petty Cash only really exists to make Another Dollar smaller. 
-Nothing Ever Changes, which is for 'duplicate' items that have multiple forms but are essentially the same item. 
-Spirit Forgery, which covers the art of creating spirit chains and spirit links. Links can be placed in spirit chains to increase aspects of your character (keep an eye out for cheap chains from the Catalogue.) 
-Quick Alchemy, which is a list of items which can be created exponentially faster using a sufficient altar of worship.
The Catalogue is pretty self explanatory. 
-Customer Service is for gaining cash as opposed to spending it. 
-Clearance is for items that cost less than a bundle of hundred dollar bills. 
-Loyalty is for the Foodplace Loyalty program, which can be accessed via a mailbox and requires Foodplace Loyalty Cards. 
-Blockbusters are for busting the block. A VHS player can be used to buy weapons and explosives, but there could be a V.H.S or two out there somewhere.
-Book Shelf is for books.
-Top Shelf is for things that cost more than a bundle of hundred dollar bills, real primo shit.

Oh, and make sure you give the Ethereal Wardrobe a look, it's fun to pretend.

Every day you'll receive a 'paycheck' based on your qualifications at the time. Usually this is just minimum wage. Depending on your qualifications, you might receive something based on your spirit instead.
One thing to keep in mind: certain qualifications can mark you as one of three paths. These don't necessarily change the way you play, but they do change the way some aspects of the game will react to you. 
For example, a pact would brand you as a servant of unsavory powers. Praying might not be as effective as if you were Spiritual. The three paths are Good, Magic, and Evil. Good effects will usually be extreme 
direct buffs and Evil effects would generally be cheap, effective and consequential. Magic links the two, meaning you could generally be considered both Magic and either Good or Evil at the same time. At the end of the day,
this is a Magic mod. Good is usually an easy mark to gain and to lose, while Evil is easy to gain but hard to lose. Magic is usually a hard mark to maintain, but there are ways to brand yourself with it. Signet rings are one example
of something that could brand someone as a Magic user, as they're of a magical 'gold and silver' order. The 'Linguistics' are powerful potions that let you speak to the realm beyond, focusing your qualifications. 

The single most important thing to know is that the world is rapidly getting worse. By the end of the fiscal year, all hell will break loose. Best to climb the corporate ladder while you still can. Another Day, Another Dollar. 


All thanks to KorGgenT for creating Magiclysm in the first place. Hope it's enjoyed.

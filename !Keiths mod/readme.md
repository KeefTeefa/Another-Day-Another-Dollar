#Mod Info
Another Day, Another Dollar is about precisely that; making another dollar every day. It adds something like 100 new spells, 30 monsters, 10 locations, a ridiculous number of items, and a suite of new NPCs.
Cash has new value, easily traded for almost anything to the right buyer. Operators are new shopkeepers, found at forges and elsewhere throughout the world, that provide a new source of Denarius. 
The prices of items in Another Day, Another Dollar are far above those in the base game. They don't sell well, but they're expensive to buy. The mod's goal is to provide a late game challenge that can only be conquered
through planning. Boss enemies will appear that are simply above the level of a base-game character, which are necessary to advance into the final tier of the game and face the one that started this mess. 

In this world, magic was as worthless as everything else, tossed aside as soon as the new model came out. The value of the dollar plummeted, disappearing into the top of the pyramid.
Magical trinkets and scrolls can be found in any home, making anyone a would-be wizard. Some NPCs will spawn with spells, others can be taught easily. Either way, Hell has come to Earth. 
Goblins, the vanguard of Hell, were the first to arrive and set up encampments. Soon, ghosts of the dead found themselves bound to this plane. Then demons, foul-smelling creatures made of Brimstone tore the rest to shreds.
By the end of the fiscal year, the world will crawl with the forces of Hell. It's lieutenants will soon make their appearance. In the meantime, it's best you spend your time wisely. It's just any other day, after all.

#Getting Started
First off, cold hard cash is now your best friend. Even after the Earth was destroyed, somebody is still selling goods for top dollar. Guess they need the cash for something. The construction menu can be used to create
Altars of Worship, which are used as tools. The first level of Worship is needed to buy from the Catalogue, a new section in the Crafting Menu. Here, cash can be spent for just about anything. Another Day serves as 
the miscellaneous section where magical items can be crafted with new and old ingredients. Watch out for twisted souls, they can be activated to increase your intelligence and mana capacity, or save them and turn them 
into a stronger version when your Spellcraft is higher. I recommend you play with other mods that make you stronger like Bombastic Perks, Stats through Kills, or Mind Over Matter. Some enemies are best left alone in this 
mod, at least until you can find some way to pull the wool over their eyes. Some enemies will be resistant to certain damage types, like Blastlids (tiny, bothersome imps made of Brimstone) who laugh off flames. In exchange, 
an Ice Spike would tear straight through the little guy! If you feel too weak, you can always get into spirit forgery, allowing you to tailor your strengths and weaknesses. Better that than a Pact with the One Below, 
which would cast God aside and leave you stranded in his waking hell.

Oh, and make sure you give the Ethereal Wardrobe a look, it's fun to pretend.

All thanks to KorGgenT for creating Magiclysm in the first place. Hope it's enjoyed.
